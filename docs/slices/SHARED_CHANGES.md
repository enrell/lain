# Shared changes — reading + downloads slice

Every edit this slice makes outside its own packages, so the parallel
SOCIAL slice can avoid or resolve conflicts. Own packages (no conflict
expected): `internal/downloads/`, `internal/plugins/comic/`,
`cmd/lain/download*.go`, `internal/gateway/downloads*.go`,
`web/src/routes/settings/downloads/`, `web/src/lib/api/downloads.ts`.

| File | Change | Conflict risk |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `internal/kv/kv.go` | New bucket constant `BDownloads` (`downloads`) added to the `Open` bucket list. | Low: one appended identifier; if social adds a bucket too, keep both in the list. |
